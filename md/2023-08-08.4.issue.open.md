# [\#4 Issue](https://github.com/btdig/dhtcrawler2/issues/4) `open`: move away from github, for censorship-resistant collaboration

All the admins of <https://github.com/btdig> are shadowbanned on GitHub.

Even if they respond, we won't see it.

This should be moved to a more piracy-friendly hosting, something in Russia or China?

russia and china sound like bad candidates, but the whole world is heading towards more censorship... for example the [digital services act](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=63043) to censor "illegal" content in europe.

i would prefer a distributed git solution, hosted on <s>clearnet (github.com, gitlab.com, try.gitea.io, codeberg.org, sr.ht, ...) and darknet (darktea, humanrightstech, ... see also my [darknet-git-hosting-services](https://github.com/milahu/darknet-git-hosting-services)) and</s> [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) ([radicle is no longer based on IPFS](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-alpha/issues/689)) or [git-ssb](https://git.scuttlebot.io/%25n92DiQh7ietE%2BR%2BX%2FI403LQoyf2DtR3WQfCkDKlheQU%3D.sha256).

<s>with multiple git repos, we have the problem of syncing between multiple git repos. issues and PRs could be exported to the git repo, so they are shared across all mirrors. for github there is [gh2md](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md), or generally [git-bug](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug). but this syncing-of-user-feedback would require some moderation, to avoid abuse by malicious users...</s>

as a communication channel, [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) (which sucks because [nostr is based on JSON which is slow](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/512), and because [nostr does not have a chain of events](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/569)) or [ssb](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-server) (secure scuttlebutt) would be interesting, because they have a "nomadic identity" feature. or [zeronet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) (based on bittorrent)...?

by the way, i have archived the github issues in my [github-issues](https://github.com/milahu/dhtcrawler2/tree/github-issues) branch with [archive-github-issues.sh](https://github.com/milahu/dhtcrawler2/blob/archive-github-issues/archive-github-issues.sh)
