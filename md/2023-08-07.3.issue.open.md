# [\#3 Issue](https://github.com/btdig/dhtcrawler2/issues/3) `open`: add support for complex search queries

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12958815?v=4" width="50">[milahu](https://github.com/milahu) opened issue at [2023-08-07 13:19](https://github.com/btdig/dhtcrawler2/issues/3):

- search exact sequence of words, for example `"Some.Movie.2020-YIFY.mkv"`
- search in title, for example `title(some words to search)`
- search in file names, for example `file(some-file.txt)`
- search in file paths, for example `path(**/relative/path/to/file.txt)` or `path(absolute/path/to/file.txt)`
- search by file hash (v2 torrents)
- filter by age, for example `age(under 1 year)` or `age(between year 2000 and year 2010)`
- filter by size, for example `size(over 1 GB)`
- filter by number of files, for example `files(over 10)`

current situation:

- dhtcrawler2 has optional support for [sphinxsearch](https://github.com/sphinxsearch/sphinx/), which was open-source until version 2, and now is closed source, see [sphinxsearch.com](https://sphinxsearch.com/). sphinxsearch is written in C++
- [btdig.com](https://btdig.com/) search is based on [lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), which is written in java (slower than C/C++/Rust). [clucene](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene/) is a rewrite of lucene in C++, so its faster than lucene
  - index size: btdig.com currently has indexed about 60 million torrents. as a comparison, [solidtorrents.to](https://solidtorrents.to/) has indexed about 40 million torrents

possible solutions:

- write a custom search engine from scratch, based on postgreSQL full text search, a search query parser, and a SQL query generator.
  - the query parser could be written with the [lemon](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/) parser generator, and the web interface could have a query parser in javascript (based on [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) and/or [lezer-parser](https://github.com/lezer-parser/lr)), to provide live incremental parsing (and validation) of the user input
- use some search engine library
  - [clucene](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene/) - written in C++
  - [xapian](https://xapian.org/) - written in C++

my first impression is that search engine libraries like sphinx/lucene/xapian are overkill, because they focus on document search, with features like fuzzy search, query suggestions, spell checking. im not sure how important these features are for btdig

alternative solutions:

- [solidtorrents.to](https://solidtorrents.to/) has support for some complex queries, see [Introducing SolidTorrents ยง Advanced Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/a4ehwc/introducing_solidtorrents_new_torrent_search/)
  - wrap the keywords with quote like `"Keyword1 keyword2"` for exact match.
  - and you can also do `-keyword` to remove the keyword from search result.
  - you can also put `|` in between keywords to specify or. like `keyword1 | Keyword2` It will return results which matches either of the keywords.
  - You can also use `*` parameter to match anything. like `some web series s1ep*`
  - etc etc

All the admins of <https://github.com/btdig> are shadowbanned on GitHub.

Even if they respond, we won't see it.

This should be moved to a more piracy-friendly hosting, something in Russia or China?

well that is interesting. explains the lack of activity

see \#4

on topic:

> - [solidtorrents.to](https://solidtorrents.to/) has support for some complex queries

ideally, solidtorrents.to would release their source code... i mean, such a search engine is rather simple to write, but still, it would save use some days of coding.

also, ideally, multiple bittorrent DHT crawlers would cooperate by sharing hashes, both a dump of old hashes, and a stream of new hashes. currently, btdig.com has 60 million torrents, that would be 60E6\*20/1E9 = 1.2 GB of v1 hashes, or 60E6\*32/1E9 = 1.92 GB of v2 hashes, so maximum 1.2+1.92 = 3.12 GB of v1+v2 hashes. sharing metadata makes no sense, because you cannot trust other DHT crawlers, and you should use hashes to crawl metadata

edit:

> sharing metadata makes no sense, because you cannot trust other DHT crawlers

but you can verify metadata by the hash

magnetico users used to share their databases. I think the idea of sharing them in real time was floated but the dev guy shut the idea down. Not sure if anyone even uses it anymore, its been retired a while now.

thanks for pointing to magnetico, see \#5
