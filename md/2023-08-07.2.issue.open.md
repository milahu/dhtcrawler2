> submit hash manually feature for user who newly created torrent should be helpful

alternative solutions:

- [solidtorrents.to](https://solidtorrents.to/) has an [add torrent](https://solidtorrents.to/add-torrent) page, which allows adding new torrents by the torrent hash. currently, only v1 torrents are supported, and v2 torrents are ignored

Hello, is there any possibility for someone to update the magnet torrent from the address "[https://en.btdig.com/6e1d0684d73e57fdddf59306f9abeeac173ab45c/warung-masterclass"](https://en.btdig.com/6e1d0684d73e57fdddf59306f9abeeac173ab45c/warung-masterclass") because I can no longer download the file, unfortunately I arrived late and I need the content. Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to it. :D
